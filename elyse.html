        <h1>To: Elyse</h1>
        <h6>
I hope this message finds you well. Di man tayo close at school, but I've noticed something special about you from afar. As we're friends on Facebook, nakikita ko profiles mo, and I must say, your smile is so so pretty.</h6>

        <h6>
It's funny how we're connected in more ways than one, and not only are we friends online, but we also share the same birthday. Like ang unique non and I can't help but find it intriguing. Kahit di tayo nag uusap online and personal, I've always felt a sense of curiosity about you.</h6>
   <h6>
I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and express my admiration for you. Elyse, Mahiyain ako but I'd love the chance to get to know you better. Maybe we can chat and talk about our shared birthday coincidence or anything else that comes to mind.</h6>

<h6>Whether or not you feel the same way, I want you to know that I value your friendship and respect your feelings. I mentioned earlier na mahiyain ako so sa pag-gawa ng webpage na lang ako nag sulat. Programming na lesson namin sa ICT ngayon but ni review ko yung mga past lessons namin para magawa ko to.</h6>

<h4>Wishing you a wonderful Valentine's Day, Elyse.</h4>
